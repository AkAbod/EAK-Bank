# EAK Bank - University Project

Welcome to **EAK Bank**, a university project for the **Software Design and Architecture** course. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a prototype banking system, combining a Python-based backend, a MySQL database, and a WordPress-based frontend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction

Everything in this project is currently **under construction**‚Äîfrom the backend app and the prototype website to this GitHub page. If you're an early supporter, thank you for your support! Updates will be made step by step as I work toward perfecting the system for use in a prototype banking website. This app is not intended for use in a real banking system at all!

## üìñ Project Overview

My banking app aims to simulate core banking functionalities in a simplified manner, focusing on the following features:

- **Account Management**: Account creation with currency and branch selection.
- **Currency Exchange**: Real-time currency conversion with bank fees.
- **Fund Transfers**: Secure transfer of funds between accounts.
- **Loan Applications**: Loan processing with interest rates fetched from the Central Bank of Turkey API (You can basically use any API).
- **Credit Card and Deposit Accounts**: Additional features if time permits.

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework.
- **Frontend**: WordPress prototype website for the bank's user interface.
- **Database**: MySQL for storing user data, accounts, and transactions.
- **APIs**: Integration with a Central Bank API interest calculations, and a live stock API for currency exchange.
